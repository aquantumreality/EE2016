# EE2016 Fall 2021

This repository contains AVR, ARM assembly and C programs written for AVR ATMega8 microcontroller and ARM LPC2378 respectively as a part of the lab work for EE2016: Microprocessors, Jul-Nov 2021.  

- For AVR assembly, we used [Microchip Studio 7.0](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/microchip-studio-for-avr-and-sam-devices) to emulate an ATmega8 microcontroller.
- For ARM assembly, we used [Keil ÂµVision5](https://www2.keil.com/mdk5/uvision/) to emulate an LPC2378 microcontroller.
