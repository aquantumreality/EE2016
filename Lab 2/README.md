# Lab 2

#### Aims of  this  experiment  are:
- Generate an external (logical) hardware interrupt using an emulation of a push button switch. 
- Write an ISR to switch ON an LED for a few seconds (10 secs) and then switch OFF. (The lighting of  the  LED  could  be  verified  by  monitoring  the  signal  to  switch  it  ON). 
- If there is time, you could try this also:  Use the **16 bit timer** to make an LED blink with a duration of  1 second. One needs to implement all of the above using C-interface.
