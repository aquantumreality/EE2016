# Lab 1

Simple computations like addition of two 8-bit and 16-bit numbers, multiplication of two 8-bit numbers using AVR Assembly, and coding a comparator in AVR Assembly Language.

  - #### [Problem 1 (Common 8-bit mathematical operation): ](https://github.com/aquantumreality/EE2016/blob/main/Lab%201/Expt1_P1.asm)
    Given two 8-bit binary words (byte), compute the sum and store it in register(s).


  - #### [Problem 2 (16-bit addition using a 8-bit processor): ](https://github.com/aquantumreality/EE2016/blob/main/Lab%201/Expt1_P2.asm)
    Given two 16-bit binary words (byte), compute the sum and store it in register(s).
   
  - #### [Problem 3 (Multiplication of two 8-bit numbers): ](https://github.com/aquantumreality/EE2016/blob/main/Lab%201/Expt1_P3.asm)
    Given two 8-bit binary words (byte), compute the product and store it in register(s).
   
  - #### [Problem 4 (Largest of number given): ](https://github.com/aquantumreality/EE2016/blob/main/Lab%201/Expt1_P4.asm)
    Given a finite set of binary words, load them from memory, identify the largest in the given set, and store this largest number in SRAM.
