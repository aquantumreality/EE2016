Simple computations like addition of two 8-bit and 16-bit numbers, multiplication of two 8-bit numbers using AVR Assembly, and coding a comparator in AVR Assembly Language.

  - #### Problem 1 (Common 8-bit mathematical operation):
    Given two 8-bit binary words (byte), compute the sum and store it in register(s).


  - #### Problem 2 (16-bit addition using a 8-bit processor):
    Given two 16-bit binary words (byte), compute the sum and store it in register(s).
   
  - #### Problem 3 (Multiplication of two 8-bit numbers): 
    Given two 8-bit binary words (byte), compute the product and store it in register(s).
   
  - #### Problem 4 (Largest of number given):
    Given a finite set of binary words, load them- from memory, identify the largest in the given set, and store this largest number in
