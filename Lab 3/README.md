# Lab 3

Solve the following engineering problems using ARM through assembly programs.
   
 - #### [Problem 1: Factorial](https://github.com/aquantumreality/EE2016/tree/main/Lab%203/Factorial)
  Compute the factorial of a given number using ARM processor through assembly programming.
  - #### [Problem 2: LIST](https://github.com/aquantumreality/EE2016/tree/main/Lab%203/LIST)
  Combine the low four bits of each of the four consecutive bytes beginning at LIST into one 16-bit halfword. The value at LIST goes into the most signicant nibble of the result. Store the result in the 32-bit variable RESULT.
  - #### [Problem 3: Odd-Even](https://github.com/aquantumreality/EE2016/tree/main/Lab%203/Odd-Even)
  Given a 32-bit number, identify whether it is an even or odd. (Your implementation should not involve division).
