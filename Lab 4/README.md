#### ARM C-Interfacing - Emulation of Switch LED and Stepper Motor Control.
   - #### Problem 1:
     Write a program (in C) to dis-assemble a byte into two nibbles from the DIP switch states, multiply and display the product in the LED.
   - #### Problem 2:
     Write a C program to demonstrate the control of stepper motor to rotate in opposite direction to that of the direction shown in demo code. 
   - #### Problem 3:
     Let us assume the step angle as 5 degrees. Write a C program to make the motor rotate until 100 degress and stop thereafter.
