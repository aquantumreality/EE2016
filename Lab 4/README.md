#### ARM C-Interfacing - Emulation of Switch LED and Stepper Motor Control.
   - #### [Problem 1: Byte Disassembly](https://github.com/aquantumreality/EE2016/blob/main/Lab%204/byte-disassembly.c)
     Write a program (in C) to dis-assemble a byte into two nibbles from the DIP switch states, multiply and display the product in the LED.
   - #### [Problem 2: Emulation of Stepper Motor Control](https://github.com/aquantumreality/EE2016/blob/main/Lab%204/byte-disassembly.c)
     Write a C program to demonstrate the control of stepper motor to rotate in opposite direction to that of the direction shown in demo code. 
   - #### [Problem 3: Rotation by a fixed angle](https://github.com/aquantumreality/EE2016/blob/main/Lab%204/stepper_2.c)
     Let us assume the step angle as 5 degrees. Write a C program to make the motor rotate until 100 degress and stop thereafter.
