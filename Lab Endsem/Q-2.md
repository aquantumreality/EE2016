## Q2: 
- This is an exercise to test your understanding of an assembly code written for a 7 segment display control.
- Assume that the values stored in the memory locations are as shown below.

| Memory Location | Value Stored | Decimal Value Stored | ASCII Value |
|---|--|--|--|
|0x2000| 0x7E| 0| 0x30 |
|0x2001| 0x30| 1| 0x31 |
|0x2002| 0x6D| 2| 0x32 |
|0x2003| 0x79| 3| 0x33 |
|0x2004| 0x33| 4| 0x34 |
|0x2005| 0x5B| 5| 0x35 |
|0x2006| 0x5F| 6| 0x36 |
|0x2007| 0x70| 7| 0x37 |
|0x2008| 0x7F| 8| 0x38 |
|0x2009| 0x7B| 9| 0x39 |

Assume that the key pressed is ‘6’. Whenever any key pressed, the corresponding ASCII code is stored in the location 0x0800 (which is conventional in designs). 

- Go through the following code and match the questions provided with their correct solutions.
