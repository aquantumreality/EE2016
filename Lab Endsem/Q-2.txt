This is an exercise to test your understanding of an assembly code written for a 7 segment display control. 

Assume that the key pressed is ‘6’. Whenever any key pressed, the corresponding ASCII code is stored in the location 0x0800 (which is conventional in designs). 

Go through the following code and match the questions provided with their correct solutions.
